# CIP STEM Overlay

An open-source tool that overlays **DHS STEM OPT eligibility** onto official **NCES CIP definitions**, providing searchable, filterable, and versioned insight into STEM-designated degree programs.

This project does **not** replace official DHS or NCES resources. It adds an intelligence layer to make STEM eligibility easier to discover, audit, and understand.
